## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsifaBeedi/securenotes.git
cd securenotes
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/securenotes
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
PORT=5001
```

**Important**: Change the `JWT_SECRET` to a secure random string in production.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The frontend `.env` should contain:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

### 4. Database Setup

Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:

- **Local MongoDB**: Start MongoDB service
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Update the `MONGODB_URI` in backend/.env with your Atlas connection string

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5001`

### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Register**: Create a new account with username, email, and password
2. **Login**: Sign in with your credentials
3. **Create Notes**: Add new encrypted notes
4. **Manage Notes**: View, edit, or delete your notes
5. **Logout**: Securely log out of your account

## API Endpoints

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [AsifaBeedi](https://github.com/AsifaBeedi) - Encrypted Note Taking Application

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Author:** Asifa Bandulal Beedi  
**License:** MIT

## Project Overview

Secure Notes is a full-stack web application that enables users to create, edit, and store notes with client-side AES-256 encryption. The application implements a zero-knowledge architecture where all encryption occurs on the client side before data transmission, ensuring complete privacy and security of user data.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
The application follows a zero-knowledge security model where the server never has access to unencrypted user data. All note content is encrypted using AES-256 encryption in the browser before being transmitted to the server. This approach ensures that even if the server is compromised, user data remains secure.

### Client-Side Encryption Implementation
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Process**: User password generates encryption keys using PBKDF2 with salt
- **Security**: Each note is encrypted with a unique initialization vector (IV)
- **Storage**: Only encrypted data is stored in the database

### Authentication System
- **Method**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Tokens expire after 7 days and are stored in localStorage
- **Protection**: Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

## Technology Stack and Justifications

### Backend Technologies

**Node.js with Express.js**
- **Rationale**: JavaScript ecosystem consistency across frontend and backend
- **Benefits**: Non-blocking I/O for handling concurrent connections, extensive npm ecosystem
- **Performance**: Event-driven architecture handles multiple users efficiently

**MongoDB**
- **Rationale**: Document-based storage naturally fits encrypted note data structure
- **Flexibility**: Schema-less design allows easy feature expansion
- **Scalability**: Built-in sharding capabilities for horizontal scaling
- **Integration**: JSON-like documents integrate seamlessly with JavaScript

**JWT Authentication**
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalable**: Works well in distributed systems and microservices
- **Standard**: Industry-standard with broad library support
- **Security**: Configurable expiration and secure signing

### Frontend Technologies

**React with TypeScript**
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors at compile-time, reducing runtime bugs
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components promote maintainable code
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- **Ecosystem**: Large community and extensive library support

**Crypto-js Library**
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Reliable cryptographic operations in the browser
- **AES-256 Support**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 support for secure key generation
- **Battle-Tested**: Well-established library with security audits

## Features Implementation

### Core Security Features

**Client-Side Encryption Process**
1. User enters master password on dashboard access
2. Password is used to derive encryption keys using PBKDF2
3. Note content is encrypted with AES-256-CBC before API calls
4. Server stores only encrypted data with metadata
5. Decryption occurs only in the browser when notes are retrieved

**Authentication Flow**
1. User registration with username, email, and password validation
2. Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds) before database storage
3. JWT token generation upon successful authentication
4. Token-based API authentication for protected routes
5. Automatic token refresh and logout on expiration

### Application Features

**Note Management**
- Create, read, update, and delete encrypted notes
- Rich text editing with Markdown support and live preview
- Tag-based organization system for note categorization
- Search functionality across note titles and tags
- Note sharing with expirable share links

**User Interface**
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Master password prompt for encryption key derivation
- Real-time Markdown preview in note editor
- Tag management with add/remove functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities

**Security Measures**
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Input validation using express-validator
- CORS configuration for cross-origin request protection
- Helmet.js for security headers implementation
- MongoDB injection prevention through parameterized queries

## Database Schema Design

### User Model
```javascript
{
  username: String (3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscore)
  email: String (unique, validated)
  password: String (bcrypt hashed)
  timestamps: CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
}
```

### Note Model
```javascript
{
  title: String (max 200 characters)
  encryptedContent: String (AES-256 encrypted)
  author: ObjectId (reference to User)
  tags: Array of Strings (max 10 tags, 50 chars each)
  isShared: Boolean
  shareToken: String (for shared notes)
  shareExpiresAt: Date (expiration for shared notes)
  timestamps: CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with validation
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication and token generation
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user information (protected)

### Notes Routes
- `GET /api/notes` - Retrieve user notes with pagination and search
- `GET /api/notes/:id` - Get specific note with encrypted content
- `POST /api/notes` - Create new encrypted note
- `PUT /api/notes/:id` - Update existing note
- `DELETE /api/notes/:id` - Delete note
- `POST /api/notes/:id/share` - Generate shareable link for note
- `GET /api/notes/shared/:token` - Access shared note via token

## Security Considerations

### Encryption Security
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 1000 iterations and random salt
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC with random initialization vectors
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys never transmitted to server
- **Data Protection**: Server cannot decrypt user content

### Authentication Security
- **Password Storage**: bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout on token expiration
- **Brute Force Protection**: Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using express-validator
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy headers via Helmet.js
- **CSRF Protection**: JWT tokens and secure cookie handling
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: MongoDB parameterized queries
